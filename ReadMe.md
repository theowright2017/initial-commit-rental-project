Rental System Project
This system is designed to allow the owner of a motorcycle store to manage his rentals.

-- It allows you to add, remove and edit customers, add, remove and edit stock items, and assign and remove rentals.

-- When a rental is assigned, it alters a marker to show that it is now unavailable ('t' or 'f' under 'availability').  

-- When the rental is deleted, this marker reverts back to show it is now available again

-- This also affects the ability to select that vehicle when creating a new rental, as it will be unavailable.


* There is also an option on the stock list page to filter by manufacturer, and then reset list to show all stock again.

* As the customer list grows, the manager will also be able to search for any existing customer, by name or included letters.
